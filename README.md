# quake2-msvc
Vanilla Quake 2 Source Code for MSVC 2022.

This is the original Quake 2 source code from ID Software (quake2, ref_gl, game) fixed to compile with Visual Studio 2022.
A few little bugs were fixed, the code can compile and run natively on both x86 and x64.


1. Clone this repo and navigate to 'code', then open 'quake2.sln' in VS2022.
2. Hit 'Build All' to compile quake2 exe, ref_gl and game DLLs.
3. Copy your `baseq2` folder from Quake 2 instalation and have fun.
